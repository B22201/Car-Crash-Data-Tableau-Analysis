# Car-Crash-Data-Tableau-Analysis

This tableau analysis was completed for a final project during an undergrad Data Analytics and Visualization course. My group choose to analyze car crash data in our local counties using primary data from the Indiana government website.

Our primary goal of the analysis, was to derive insights into factors that cause accidents to happen in our local area and to recommend actions that could be taken to reduce the quantity of accidents.
